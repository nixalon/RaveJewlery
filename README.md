# RaveJewlery
 
 This NewPixel is designed to be a super cool (single) earring och necklace to use at like a rave or something. When I googled inspiration for it, 
 it turned out this type of jewlery was a typical way to blend in at places like the Burning Man. And here I thought I had an original idea...
 
 # The user
 This product is mainly designed for men, simply because it's got lots of parts to it and women's pockets simply aren't big enough to carry it all around. 
 Or just shove everything apart from the neopixel into a fannypack. That works too. Then anyone can use it. 
 
 # How to use the RaveJewlery
 First, attach the NeoPixel to a chain or earring and put all other components into a pocket or fannypack. Keep the remote control in your hand. 
 The buttons 1-9 make different patterns and colors on the neopixel. The pros of having a remote control is that the user can choose between 9 different patterns. 
 The cons are of course that the user has to carry around a remote control and direct it towards the IR sensor to change a pattern. 
 
 # The buttons
 1-3: Make the entire NeoPixel go red, green or blue
 4-6: Every third pixel, and the one next to it, shines in a different color
 7: Every second pixel blinks in white. The next round the pixels that were lit will be turned off. And then it goes on like this forever.
 8: The right and left side of the NewPixel light up in red, green and blue, but the top and the bottom do not. 
 9: The NeoPixel gradually becomes more red, then gradually adds green, and then blue. So it's mostly red.. 
 The Off button: clears all color.
